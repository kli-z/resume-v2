    <p>Dogs or cats? It's hard to say, since I've never owned a dog. I do own a cat, and his name
      is Ike. He's a great cat and all, but sometimes I wonder if the extra maintenance for a
      dog would be worth it for more feedback, as I'm sure some of us can relate.

    <p>I do play the guitar, and I have been for roughly 5 years, though my time between practice
      sessions was admittedly rather long and infrequent—that is, until I picked up Rocksmith 2014,
      a game on the computer that you connect to with your guitar. Aside from its main functionality,
      where you learn songs, it can also function as a tuner and as an amp with settings equal to
      whatever songs you may have in its library.

    <p>My guitar is an ESP LTD F-50. As its shape may suggest, I am certainly a fan of metal, punk,
      and the heavier side of rock—but only for the instruments themselves. I often pay little or
      no attention to lyrics, and I don't really condone anything that they might say, especially
      since punk songs can often be very political. I just treat vocals like any other instrument,
      and I notice tone and pitch before I interpret words.

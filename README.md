Project Two: Responsive, Relative-Unit CSS
Due Wednesday, October 26, 11:59pm CT

This project builds on Project One, which you will fully style with CSS to provide a basic typographic treatment and responsive design that makes judicious use of media queries and relative units (em/rem, vw, %). You will deploy your pages to a server pointed at by your personal domain name, or a subdomain if you have an existing professional web presence.

Project Goals

    Produce modern standards-compliant, mobile-first CSS
    Organize site typography with a modular scale, and set type on a baseline grid
    Execute responsive design with flexible media and fluid grids, expressed as percentages
    Continue to write and revise valid, well-formed semantic HTML
    Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability
    Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using version control
    Deploy web pages to a public server (can be GitHub pages, set up with your own domain name or subdomain)

Deliverables & Milestones

    A video presentation of your work in progress, hosted on YouTube, Vimeo, or another similar service and posted to Basecamp. Your Basecamp post should include the URL to your GitHub repository, and the live URL to your project if you’ve established one by then. Include in the text of your post one or two specific things you would like feedback or help on from the instructor and other students in the class (due no later than October 12).
    Substantive comments critiquing at least three other student projects. (by October 19, 11:59pm CT)
    An email to the instructor containing the projects final deliverables (by October 26, 11:59pm CT):
        A 4-5 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point (write in the body of the email)
        The public http:// or https:// link pointing to your live project
        The https:// link to your project’s GitHub repository

Requirements

    Multiple linked valid, well-formed semantic HTML files (Project 1, essentially)
    HTML-based fallbacks for any media elements (image, audio, video) that you include
    One single valid, error-free CSS file. Do not create more than one single screen.css file for your project
    Your HTML and CSS files should both be indented with 2 spaces per level of indent; indent all CSS style rules inside the declaring block, and further indent all rules and blocks inside your media queries
    Open your CSS file with a set of reset styles (such as the minified Eric Meyer resets from class demos)
    Use of only relative units (em, rem, vm, %) in your CSS; no px, pt, or other absolute units allowed
    Use at least two min-width media queries to enhance your mobile-first styles for larger screens
    Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators, no Bootstrap or other off-the-shelf HTML or CSS frameworks)
    A Git repository with frequent commits and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make
    GitHub repository must contain only the files and commits from this project; you are encouraged to use and further improve your HTML files from Project 1
